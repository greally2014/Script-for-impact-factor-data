# Script-for-impact-factor-data
Scrapes impact factor data on journals in Wiley's maths and stats division from Web of Science and exports it to an Excel Spreadsheet.  As it cycles on journal at a time it can be used at any time to update the data in the event of a new journal being added or the impact factor data for a new year being uploaded.

You need to have BeautifulSoup, Pandas and Selenium modules installed if you want the code to run.

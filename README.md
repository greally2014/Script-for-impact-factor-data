# Script-for-impact-factor-data
Scrapes impact factor data on journals in Wiley's maths and stats division from Web of Science and exports it to an Excel Spreadsheet.  As it cycles on journal at a time it can be used at any time to update the data in the event of a new journal being added or the impact factor data for a new year being uploaded.

You need to have BeautifulSoup, Pandas and Selenium modules installed.  The excel database the code used to obtain the journal names who's data was to be scraped contains confidential company information and cannot be uploaded to the repository.

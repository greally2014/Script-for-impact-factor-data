# Script-for-Journal-Impact-Factor-Data-from-Web-of-Science

## Description
This script automates the extraction of impact factor data from Web of Science for journals in Wiley's "maths and stats" division and exports the data in tabular form to an Excel spreadsheet. 

I wrote this script during my internship as a data analyst intern at Wiley in the summer of 2019. My team’s responsibility primarily consisted of analysing article citation data on Web of Science using Qlik Sense and drafting analytical reports for editorial conferences. I wrote this script to automate the data extraction process in order to improve the rate at which my team could generate these editoral reports. 

## Installation and Usage
The script uses BeautifulSoup4 and Selenium to automate data extraction. Selenium was required because the data was contained in Javascript links. This script is not intened to be downloaded and reused. It requires company membership in order to access the required webpages for data extraction. I am uploading this to showcase my role as a data analyst during my internship in the summer of 2019.
